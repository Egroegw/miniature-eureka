## Explanatory Notes and Sources

As I have never written more than "Hello World!" in Javascript before, this first problem set was an interesting challenge. The language I come from is Python, but I am also learning Rust.

My initial plan was to
1. understand how to store text and items in Javascript
2. understand how to incorporate Javascript into an HTML document, and
3. understand how to use CSS to improve the visual and aesthetic nature of the TODO list.

The reason I put CSS last was that I assumed functionality came before aesthetics.
The initial tutorial/introduction to Javascript I used was w3schools.com's. Unfortunately, w3schools.com's tutorial is incomplete, omitting basic syntax such as `for (var item of array)`. Consequently, halfway through, I ran to Mozilla's tutorial instead: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/.

### Incorporating Javascript into an HTML document
Well, this turned out to be simpler than expected. Simply place content inside enclosing `<script>` tags: `<script> // some Javascript function or variable </script>`.

JS can be inline, or in an external file.

### Storing text and items in Javascript
This was somewhat more difficult than embedding Javascript. Surprisingly, Javascript doesn't have Python lists: it has arrays instead.

### Misc notes

* I kept using .Trim() on a string instead of .trim()
* In Rust, the final expression is automatically returnedï¼Œ without needing the "return" keyword. I forgot to use the "return" keyword in isEmptyString() for a long time. 
* There are four ways to "print" something in Javascript, none as simple as Python's print().
